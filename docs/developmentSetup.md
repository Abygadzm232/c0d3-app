# Welcome to Development Setup!

If you are reading this you are ready to contribute to c0d3.com!

To begin we will need to set up the code base on your own machine. To do this we will be creating a copy of the **c0d3** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/garageScript/c0d3-app).

## Prerequisites

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Node Version 10](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

![forkExample](developmentSetup/forkExample.png)

1. Click on the button in the top right corner with the text `Fork` to create a copy of this repository.

   * ![cloneExample](developmentSetup/cloneExample.png)

   * **Notice** in the top left corner of the screenshot above that it states that the repository was forked from garageScript/c0d3-app

2. Click on the "Clone or download" green button and copy the `ssh` or `https` url.
3. Navigate to your terminal and clone: `git clone url-goes-here`
4. After cloning, you will want to change the current directory to the `c0d3-app` folder that was created.
5. `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies needed to run the app.
6. `yarn run dev` to start our application locally. You can now navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser and you will see the application.

### You are now all setup on your machine! Keep up the great work and thank you for your contributions üëç
